## A Delightful Tasting Menu of Semantic Kernel Capabilities

Welcome to the Semantic Kernel (SK) Snack repository! This culinary-inspired collection serves up a delectable assortment of examples showcasing Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework for building intelligent AI Agents and AI Agentic systems.

## What's on the Menu?

Our [signature tasting menu](sk_snack.ipynb) offers a progressive journey through Semantic Kernel's capabilities, from a simple chat appetizer to a multi-agent collab main courses.

## Quick Start with Dev Container

This repository includes a `.devcontainer` configuration that provides a pre-configured environment with everything you need to run the examples. To use the Dev Container:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code with the Dev Containers extension installed
3. When prompted, click *Reopen in Container*
4. Edit the `.env` file to add your Azure OpenAI credentials
5. Open the [sk_snack.ipynb](sk_snack.ipynb) notebook
6. Select the Python .venv as your notebook kernel
6. Follow along with each *bite* to experience the full Semantic Kernel tasting menu

## Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use the Dev Container:

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI credentials
3. Install dependencies with `uv sync --prerelease=allow`
4. Open the [sk_snack.ipynb](sk_snack.ipynb) notebook
5. Select the Python .venv as your notebook kernel
6. Follow along with each "bite" to experience the full Semantic Kernel tasting menu
